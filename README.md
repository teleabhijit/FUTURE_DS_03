# FUTURE_DS_03

📊 College Event Feedback Analysis – Internship Project
📌 Overview

This project analyzes student feedback collected from college events (tech fests, workshops, cultural activities, etc.) to derive actionable insights. Using Python, Pandas, NLP, and Visualization libraries, we explore both numerical ratings and textual comments to understand student satisfaction and suggest improvements.

This task was completed as part of the Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Task 3 internship

Data Science & Analytics Task 3…

.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess feedback data from CSV (Google Forms export).

Analyze ratings (1–5 scale) to identify satisfaction trends.

Perform sentiment analysis on student comments (Positive, Neutral, Negative).

Visualize insights with bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds.

Recommend improvements for future college events.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook – coding environment

pandas – data manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn – data visualization

TextBlob / VADER – sentiment analysis

wordcloud – text visualization

📂 Project Structure
├── FUTURE_DS_03.ipynb        # Main Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)
├── student_feedback.csv      # Sample dataset (Google Form export)
└── README.md                 # Project documentation

📊 Sample Insights

✅ Events with highest satisfaction scores

❌ Common complaints highlighted in feedback (via word cloud)

📈 Correlation between ratings and event type (workshops vs. seminars)

🏆 Departments that hosted the most-liked events

🚀 How to Run

Open Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload FUTURE_DS_03.ipynb and student_feedback.csv.

Run all cells step by step.

Visualizations and sentiment insights will be generated automatically.

📑 Deliverables

A clean, well-commented notebook (FUTURE_DS_03.ipynb)

Visual reports: bar charts, pie charts, word clouds

Sentiment summary (Positive/Neutral/Negative distribution)

Recommendations for event organizers
